### Expense Tracker

The **Expense Tracker** project is an innovative application designed to help users manage their personal finances by effortlessly tracking their expenses. Developed during my tenure as a **Software Engineer Fellow** at **Headstarter**, this project leverages cutting-edge technologies to simplify the process of recording and analyzing spending habits.

## Project Overview

The Expense Tracker enables users to capture and track their expenses through a user-friendly web interface. It employs **AI image recognition** technology to automatically extract items and prices from receipts, streamlining the input process and reducing the burden of manual entry. This allows users to quickly update their expense records without the hassle of remembering every detail.

## Technologies Used

- **Web Development**: The application is built using modern web development frameworks, providing a responsive and intuitive user experience. Users can easily navigate the interface to view their spending patterns and manage their budgets effectively.
  
- **Firebase**: To store user data securely, the Expense Tracker utilizes Firebase, a powerful platform that offers real-time database capabilities. This ensures that all expense data is synced seamlessly across devices, allowing users to access their financial information anytime, anywhere.

- **AI Image Recognition**: The core functionality of tracking items and prices is powered by advanced AI algorithms that analyze images of receipts. This technology accurately identifies products and their corresponding prices, automatically updating the user’s expense tracker with minimal user input.

## Features

- **Receipt Scanning**: Users can take pictures of their receipts, and the AI will automatically parse the image to extract relevant information such as item names and prices.
  
- **Real-time Expense Tracking**: As receipts are scanned and processed, the application updates the user’s expense records in real time, providing immediate insights into their spending habits.

- **Budget Management**: Users can set budgets for different categories and monitor their spending against these limits, promoting better financial habits.

- **Analytics Dashboard**: The application features an analytics dashboard that visualizes spending trends over time, helping users make informed financial decisions.

## Conclusion

The Expense Tracker project is a practical solution for individuals seeking to take control of their finances through innovative technology. By combining web development, Firebase, and AI image recognition, we have created an effective tool that simplifies expense management. This project reflects my commitment to leveraging technology to enhance everyday life and improve financial literacy among users.
